# Contributing Guide

This document describes the requirements for committing to this repository.

## Contributor License Agreement

This repository is governed under a [Contributor License
Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/deislabs/krustlet). All PR
submitters must accept the CLA before their contributions can be merged.

## Pull Request Management

All code that is contributed to Krustlet must go through the Pull Request (PR)
process. To contribute a PR, fork this project, create a new branch, make
changes on that branch, and then use GitHub to open a pull request with your
changes.

Every PR must be reviewed by at least one Core Maintainer of the project. Once
a PR has been marked "Approved" by a Core Maintainer (and no other core
maintainer has an open "Rejected" vote), the PR may be merged. While it is fine
for non-maintainers to contribute their own code reviews, those reviews do not
satisfy the above requirement.

[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the
[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)
